Continuous Deployment (CD) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are related concepts in the realm of software development and deployment, but they have some key differences.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to a production environment. In CD, the focus is on automating the process of getting the software from the development environment to the staging or production environment, where it can be reviewed and tested by stakeholders. CD aims to reduce the lead time between code changes and the delivery of a production-ready release.

Continuous Deployment (CD), on the other hand, is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a production environment without any manual intervention. In CD, the goal is to automate the entire process of getting code changes into production, without any human involvement, as long as automated tests pass. Continuous Deployment is a more advanced practice than Continuous Delivery, and it requires a higher level of automation and confidence in the quality of the software being developed.

To sum up, Continuous Delivery is a practice that ensures software is always ready for release, but the actual release to the production environment is triggered manually. Continuous Deployment is a practice where code changes are automatically released to production, without human intervention, as long as automated tests pass. Both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment aim to reduce lead time and increase the efficiency of the software delivery process, but the level of automation and control over the release process is different.
